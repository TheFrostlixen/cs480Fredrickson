This assignment achieves 3 primary goals.

1. Implementation of a model loader (located in Model class) that dynamically allocates vertices for the model.

>NOTE: The model rotates very slightly. This is intended.

2. Encapsulation of models and relevant functions to a separate class (handles all model functions).

3. Inclusion of a custom OBJ file of a board with walls.

##Extra Credit
- Added colors to the material

##Issues Encountered
- If I started to list them all, I wouldn't make the submission deadline.

##Libraries
- GLM (OpenGL Mathematics)
- GLUT (OpenGL Utility Toolkit)

##Keyboard/mouse controls:

>NOTE: No other controls are implemented, as none were specified in the requirements for this assignment.
