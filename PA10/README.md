# PA8 - Bullet

## Extra Credit
Triangle meshes can only be used for static objects.
So a triangle mesh was used for the container that all the objects reside in for the demo.
This satisfies the extra credit to load and utilize a triangle mesh instead of using primitive objects to build a collision mesh for the container.

## Dependencies
To install the dependencies run the install_dependencies.sh script.

## Controls
WASD to control the sphere.
Arrow keys to control the cylinder.
Spacebar will make the objects "jump".

## Notes
The collision shapes for the sphere, cylinder, and cube aren't very tight for this demo but can be easily adjusted.
